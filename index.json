[{"body":"\"Auctions are allocation mechanisms1.\\n   Notations Naively, an auction is observed to have several factors. To save keystrokes, we use a set of symbols to denote the variables:\\n the seller $\\\\mathscr S$, the bidders $\\\\{\\\\mathscr B_i\\\\}$, the object $\\\\mathscr O$ to bid on, the bidding prices $\\\\{b_i\\\\}$.      In an auction, each bidder $\\\\mathscr B_i$ decides on a valuation $v_i$ of the object $\\\\mathscr O$ and bid with a bidding price $b_i$ based on the valuation.\\nThe rules may be very different in different actions but they should have two components, how the object is allocated (allocation rule) and how the bidders are paying (payment rule). A simple yet interesting example of the payment rule is that of a Vickrey auction. Vickrey auction is a type of sealed-bid auction or blind auction, where the bidders have no information about the bidding price of other bidders. In a Vickrey auction, the winner pays the second-highest price2.\\nIn general, we will observe that an auction has\\n the winner $\\\\mathscr B_w$ who takes the object $\\\\mathscr O$, the losers $\\\\mathscr B_l$, the winner\\u0026rsquo;s payment $p_w$, the losers\\u0026rsquo; payment $p_l$.  In the above bullet points, 1 and 2 are determined by the allocation rules, while 3 and 4 are determined by the payment rules.\\nIn auction theory, it is important to understand what the auction leads to, aka the equilibrium. To achieve this, we will come up with a formal representation of an auction in the following sections.\\nGame, Mechanism, and Auction The Bayesian game provides a good theoretical ground for auctions. A Bayesian game is defined by the setting and the mechanism. The setting is the stage and different mechanisms lead to different equilibria and properties.\\n   Bayesian Game Setting A Bayesian game setting is defined by $(N, O, \\\\Theta, p, u)$, where1\\n $N$ is a finite set of $n$ agents or players, e.g., bidders $\\\\{\\\\mathscr B_i\\\\}$, $O$ is a set of outcomes, $\\\\Theta$ is a set of possible types for each agent, e.g., a bidder can be type one who would squeeze in to get the deal, or type two who would avoid competitions, $p$ is some prior probability (distribution) on types $\\\\{\\\\theta_i\\\\}$, i.e., $p(\\\\Theta)$, that is shared by all agents, $u$ is a set of utility functions for all agents.    Y. Shoham and K. Leyton-Brown, “Multiagent Systems: Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, and logical foundations”, 2008. \\u0026#x21a9;\\u0026#xfe0e;\\n          Mechanism A mechanism is defined by $(A, M)$, where1\\n $A$ is a set of available actions for each agent, e.g., each bidder $\\\\mathscr B_i$ has a set of available actions $a_i$, $M$ is the map from actions to the distribution of outcomes.  With the mechanism defined, we will be able to design, implement, and measure the game.\\n  Y. Shoham and K. Leyton-Brown, “Multiagent Systems: Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, and logical foundations”, 2008. \\u0026#x21a9;\\u0026#xfe0e;\\n       The fact that auction is an allocation mechanism indicates that the outcome will be two parts, the allocation of the object $X$ and the payment $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ in an $n$ bidder auction. Comparing to the Bayesian game, we have the stage\\n $n$ bidders $\\\\{\\\\mathscr B_i\\\\}$ as the agents, the allocation $X$ together with the payment $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ are the outcomes, the valuation structures are the types, the probability distribution of the valuation structures is the common prior, utility functions of the bidders as the utility functions.  We also have the mechanism\\n bidding at different prices as actions, allocation rule (or choice rule) and payment rule map the actions to the allocation results $X$ and payment results $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$, respectively.     Mechanism The way we split the mechanism map $M$ into $X$ and $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ makes it a quasilinear mechanism, which is defined by a triple $(A_i, \\\\chi, \\\\wp)$, where1\\n $A$ is a set of actions available to bidders $\\\\{B_i\\\\}$, $\\\\xi$ is the choice rule that maps actions to the distribution of allocations, $\\\\wp$ is the payment rule that maps actions to the payments.    Y. Shoham and K. Leyton-Brown, “Multiagent Systems: Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, and logical foundations”, 2008. \\u0026#x21a9;\\u0026#xfe0e;\\n       Risk Attitude Technically speaking, the valuation $v_i$ doesn\\u0026rsquo;t necessarily equate to the bidding price $b_i$ of bidder $\\\\mathscr B_i$. The relation between valuation $v_i$ and bidding price $b_i$ is called the bidding function.\\nThe payoff of $\\\\mathscr B_i$ who bids with $b_i$ and valuation $v_i$ is $v_i - b_i$. The simplest definition of the utility function is\\n$$ \\\\begin{equation} u_i = v_i - b_i. \\\\label{eqn-auction-utility-payoff} \\\\end{equation} $$ Notice that this utility function only depends on the choice of the bidder. Though useful, this definition doesn\\u0026rsquo;t reflect the personalities of the bidder. For the personalities, we introduce a new term related to the payment $p_i$, so that the utility becomes\\n$$ \\\\begin{equation} u_i = v_i - b_i - f_i, \\\\label{eqn-auction-utility-payoff-and-payment} \\\\end{equation} $$ where $f_i$ is a function of the payment. The risk attitude is best tested in a fair lottery where the expected payoff is the same as the investment. In such a fair lottery, the utility for \\\\ref{eqn-auction-utility-payoff-and-payment} depends on the payment and the willingness to pay is different at different costs.\\nRisk neutral bidders are willing to participate at different payment based on payoff. Risk aversion bidders are less willing to participate at higher payment and risk seeking bidders are more willing to participate at higher payment3.\\nTypes of Auctions There exist many different types of auctions. Base on the allocation rules and payment rules, we may have first-price auction (FPA), second-price auction (SPA), English ascending-bid auction, Dutch descending-bid auction, etc4. Shoham and Leyton-Brown have provided a list of canonical auctions in their book3.\\nFirst-price Auction There are two key relations:\\n map from valuation $v_i$ to bid $b_i$, aka bidding function, map from bidding $b_i$ to the probability of winning $P(\\\\mathrm{win})$.  To measure the expected payoff of a bidding price $b_i$ for bidder $\\\\mathscr B_i$, we introduce the expected utility, $\\\\bar U_i$, e.g.,\\n\\\\begin{equation} \\\\bar u_i = P(\\\\mathrm{win}) (v_i - b_i) + P(\\\\mathrm{lose}) 0 = P(\\\\mathrm{win}) (v_i - b_i), \\\\end{equation}\\nwhere $P(\\\\mathrm{win})$ is the probability of winning and $P(\\\\mathrm{lose})$ is the probability of losing. Given the probability of winning, valuation, and bid, one could usually calculate the expected utility $\\\\bar U_i$.\\nThere is no dominant strategies in first-price sealed auction. Everyone could set their bid lower than their valuation and win. That being said, the bid of first-price auctions do not necessarily approach one\\u0026rsquo;s valuation. However, using the expected utility, it is proven that the strategy is to bid with $\\\\frac{n-1}{n}v_i$ where $n$ is the number of bidders and $v_i$ is its valuation, given the condition that bidders are risk-neutral with valuations being a uniform distribution.

Many have played or have been playing their own parts in this great tradition and road transportation is one of the most important modes.\\n  source: undraw.co\\n  Road transportation can either be moving passengers or goods. The latter is also called road freight. In this part, we will focus on road freight.\\nRoad freight is a rather complex system. It depends on multiple fields of research.\\nDefinition of the Problem    What is Road Freight The core activity of road freight is to move materials of some properties (weight $W$, volume $V$, and special requirements), $\\\\mathscr L(W,V,\\\\cdots)$, through route $\\\\mathscr R$ in the road network that connects a set of locations $\\\\{P_1, P_2, \\\\cdots, P_m, D_1, D_2, \\\\cdots, D_n\\\\}$, under some certain policies $\\\\mathscr P$ (order of locations, speed limits, height limit, travel restrictions, etc), using predefined vehicles $\\\\mathscr V$.     In the problem, four key factors are involved:\\n Loads: $\\\\mathscr L$; Routes: $\\\\mathscr R$; Policies: $\\\\mathscr P$; Vehicles/Capacities: $\\\\mathscr V$  Loads are loaded on to the vehicles at the pickup location and unloaded at the dropoff location. Different loads requires different facilities and equipment at pickup and dropoff, as well as different vehicles, routes, and drivers during transportation. Efficient routing also involves information on transportation time requirements, road and traffic status, and weather forecast. Different policies may be enforced by the government and shippers. The vehicles or capacities to be used is a result of the loads and policies.\\nIn many cases, the four factors are interconnect which renders a global optimization problem. Though trivial, it is important to point out that a bunch of other parties, such as infrastructure-related parties, policy makers, security staff, routing services, may also participate in this trip.\\nShipper and Carriers There are two core parties in road freight: the shipper and the carrier. The shipper is the party who provides the load and sets the expectations. The carrier is the party who transports the load.\\nA simple case is shown in the following Gantt chart.\\ngantt title A Workflow dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD section Shipper Coordinate Pickup :2020-01-01, 1d Coordinate Dropoff :2020-01-05, 1d Receive Proof of Delivery to Shipper :2020-01-06,1d Pay the Carrier :2020-01-07, 1d section Carrier Carrier Get Loads :2020-01-01, 1d Fetch Loads at Pickup Location :2020-01-02, 1d Transport to Dropoff Location :2020-01-03, 2d Dropoff :2020-01-05, 1d Provide Proof of Delivery to Shipper :2020-01-06,1d Receive the Payment :2020-01-07, 1d   Forwarders and Marketplaces In reality, connecting the shipper and carrier is no easy task. Apart from the two core parties, a third trustworthy party is usually involved. This can be either a forwarder or a marketplace. A forwarder takes in shipments from the shipper and finds a carrier for the shipment. A marketplace connects the shippers and carriers directly.\\nNetwork and Terminals The shipment may not go directly from the pickup location to the dropoff location. Networks and terminals may be use to aggregate shipments or change of transportation mode to maximize efficiency.\\n  Network and Terminals   How is Road Freight Doing  In physics, the work is measured by force multiplied by displacement. The work done per unit time is the power. There are analogies of work and power in road freight.\\n To measure the \\u0026ldquo;work\\u0026rdquo; done by road freight, a convenient measure is the weight multiplied by the distance of the trip. As an example, the unit of this \\u0026ldquo;work\\u0026rdquo; may be million tonne-kilometer.\\nIn Europe, many countries rely on road freight for transportation. To get a grasp of this idea, we measure the share of road freight of inland transportation using the percentage of tonne-kilometer transported by road freight. Most EU countries has more than half of the freight transported by road freight. In some countries, such as Malta, road freight is the single most important mode of freight transportation.\\n  Road Freight Share in EUUsing data from eurostats\\n  For the top road freight countries, the \\u0026ldquo;work\\u0026rdquo; done by road freight has been growing in the world in recent years. China and India even had one order of magnitude growth in 20 years.\\n  Road Freight Power by YearUsing data from OECD (2020), Freight transport (indicator).

In Europe, the general speed limit is around 80km/h on expressways.1 2 For completeness, we also visualized the data table on Wikipedia in topics: speed limits.\\nThe rail freight speed is comparable to road freight speeds (around 80km/h).3 However, European court of auditors found that the speed of freight trains are actually quite slow on some international routes (18 km/h) as well as some countries (20-30 km/h).4 Ocean container ships cruise at the speed of 30–46 km/h.5 Cargo aircrafts cruise at the speed of 500-900 km/h. 6\\nHowever, the speed of the vehicles doesn\\u0026rsquo;t necessarily determine the time for the cargo from door to door. Rail freight, ocean freight and air freight relies on the locations of ports and thus are mostly not door to door services. Additional transitions are requires for the cargo to reach from pickup locations to drop off locations.\\nCoverage In principle, freight trucks can go whereever the road is covered if we ignore the regulations. Ocean freight only connects ports. In 2019, 2397 ports in EU reported nonzero cargo volumes.7 Air freight connects airports. In Q4 of 2019, there are 272 airports reported nonzero freight and mail volumes in all the 28 countries of EU.8\\nReferences  Air freight 2025: Agility, speed, and partnerships Open Railway Map    Current speed limit policies in Europe \\u0026#x21a9;\\u0026#xfe0e;\\n Road Safety in Europe \\u0026#x21a9;\\u0026#xfe0e;\\n European Freight Scenarios and Impacts \\u0026#x21a9;\\u0026#xfe0e;\\n Rail freight transport in the EU: still not on the right track \\u0026#x21a9;\\u0026#xfe0e;\\n Container Ship on Wikipedia \\u0026#x21a9;\\u0026#xfe0e;\\n Cargo Aircraft @ Wikipedia \\u0026#x21a9;\\u0026#xfe0e;\\n Gross weight of goods handled in all ports by direction - annual data \\u0026#x21a9;\\u0026#xfe0e;\\n Freight and mail air transport between main airports in each reporting country and partner reporting countries \\u0026#x21a9;\\u0026#xfe0e;\\n   \"","section":"Basics","summary":"Road freight is easily spotted in our daily life.

It can be represented using a matrix, a network, or the generating process behind it.\\n   Notations In this page, we will use the following notations.\\n $P$: a set of origins; $p$: an element of $P$, i.e., an origin; $Q$: a set of destinations; $q$: an element of $Q$, i.e., a destination; $o_p$: total flow out of the origin $p$; $d_q$: total flow into destination $q$; $g_{pq}$: flow between origin $p$ and destination $q$. $\\\\{g_{pq}\\\\}$: the travel demand.      The Matrix The origin-destination matrix describes ${g_{pq}}$ for origin-destination pairs $pq\\\\in P\\\\bigotimes Q$.\\nWe show an example using the international road freight data from Eurostats.1 The are many different representations of the origin-destination matrix. The data can be represented using tabular data. On the other hand, it is easier to interpret if we introduce some visualization elements. For example, we visualize the matrix using a heatmap where we color code the amount of goods transported in unit of million-tonne-kilometer.\\n  Visualization of goods loaded unloaded in Europe. The gray cells in the charts indicates missing data.\\n  Alternatively, we can visualize this matrix using networks.\\n  Visualization of goods loaded unloaded in Europe using networks. Some countries are less connected.\\n  There are other visualizations of networks such as arc plots and circle plots. In the end, visualizations are just some of the representations of the matrix. A much more powerful representation is a way to describe the generating process of the origin-destination matrix. For example, we could represent the underlying generating process with a function. The function itself, could as well be a neural network if desired.\\nA Generating Process behind the Origin-Destination Matrix Simply describing the data is not so satisfying. What is more powerful is to find or construct a simple model to describe the underlying generating process so it can be used to find causalities and predict the future. One of such models is the gravity model.\\nThe gravity model is a simple distribution model where we assume the distribution is proportional to the two masses: the flow out of the origin and the flow into the destination. In this section, we will follow A. Peterson to demonstrate the basic ideas of this model2. The flow between origin $p$ and destination $q$ is assumed to be proportional to the multiplication of them, as the gravitational force between to massive objects,\\n$$ g_{pq} = k_{pq} o_p d_q f(\\\\pi_{pq}), $$\\nwhere $\\\\pi_{pq}$ is the travel impedance. We have\\n$$ o_p = \\\\sum_q g_{pq} $$\\nand\\n$$ d_q = \\\\sum_p g_{pq}. $$\\nThe deterrence function $f(\\\\pi_{pq})$ can have many different forms as long as it captures the factors of friction:\\n polynomial: $\\\\pi_{pq}^{-\\\\beta}$, exponential: $e^{-\\\\beta \\\\pi_{pq}}$.  The coefficient $k_{pq}$ is also taking care of the fact that the dependency on the masses $o_p$ and $d_q$ and the deterrence can be different for different lanes.\\nGiven the fact that the total flow out of $p$ is\\n$$ o_p = \\\\sum_q g_{pq} = o_p\\\\sum_q k_{pq} d_q f(\\\\pi_{pq}), $$\\nwe thus derive a simple identity\\n$$ \\\\sum_q k_{pq} d_q f(\\\\pi_{pq}) = 1. $$\\nModal Split The split of the loads between origin and destination can also be assigned to different modes, i.e., partitioning of the flow based on travel modes $g^k_{pq}$. In this section, we review a method called multinomial logit model introduced in A. Peterson (2007)2. We use the probability of modes $p_k$ to describe the split, i.e., $g_{pqk} = g_{pq}p_k$.\\nTo partition the flow, a utility function $u_k$ of each mode $k$ is introduced. The utility function considers:\\n Some attributes denoted by $h$, $h$ can be walking time, transport time, etc. All the attributes form a set $H$ where $h\\\\in H$; Travel mode $k$; The measured value of attribute $h$ for travel mode $k$: $x_{hk}$; Weighting parameter $\\\\alpha_h$.  The utility function has two major parts. The part of utility that can be modeled\\n$$ v_k = \\\\sum_h \\\\alpha_h x_{hk}, $$\\nas well as a part from the random effects. The actual utility may have some random effects $\\\\epsilon_k$,\\n$$ u_k = v_k + \\\\epsilon_k. $$\\nThe multinomial logit model assumes the probability of the mode $k$ to be\\n$$ p_k = \\\\frac{e^{\\\\mu u_k}}{ \\\\sum_k e^{\\\\mu u_k} } = \\\\frac{e^{\\\\mu v_k} e^{\\\\mu \\\\epsilon_k}}{ \\\\sum_k e^{\\\\mu u_k} e^{\\\\mu \\\\epsilon_k} }. $$\\nThe non-linearity leads to some problems. Different combination of modes leads to contradictory results.2 One solution to such problems is to come up with a fixed hierarchy model.\\nReferences  Trip distribution @ Wikipedia    Eurostats is a good place to find datasets about Europe.
