[{"body":"\"Auctions is an allocation mechanism1.\\n   What is an Auction An auction has four factors: the seller $\\\\mathscr S$, the bidders $\\\\{\\\\mathscr B_i\\\\}$, the object to be bidded on $\\\\mathscr O$, and a set of rule $\\\\{\\\\mathscr R_i\\\\}$ to determine the winner. Each bidder $\\\\mathscr B_i$ decides on an valuation $v_i$ of the object $\\\\mathscr O$.     The rules may be very different but they should have two components, the allocation rule and the payment rule. A simple yet interesting example of the payment rule is that of the Vickrey auction. Vicker auction is a type of sealed bid auction or blind auction, where the bidders have no information about the bidding price of other bidders. In a Vickrey auction, the winner pays the second highest price2.\\nThe outcome of the auction will be\\nthe bidders offered bidding prices ${b_i}$, the winner $\\\\mathscr B_w$ who takes the object $\\\\mathscr O$, the winner\\u0026rsquo;s price $p_w$, the losers $\\\\mathscr B_l$, the losers\\u0026rsquo; price $p_l$.  In the following sections, we will come up with a formal representation of an auction.\\nExpected Utility The valuation $v_i$ doesn\\u0026rsquo;t necessariy equal to the bidding price $b_i$ of bidder $\\\\mathscr B_i$. The relation between valuation $v_i$ and bidding price $b_i$ is called the bidding function.\\nTo measure the payoff of a bidding price $b_i$ for bidder $\\\\mathscr B_i$, we introduce the expected utility, $\\\\bar U_i$, e.g.,\\n\\\\begin{equation} \\\\bar u_i = P(\\\\mathrm{win}) (v_i - b_i) + P(\\\\mathrm{lose}) 0 = P(\\\\mathrm{win}) (v_i - b_i), \\\\end{equation}\\nwhere $P(\\\\mathrm{win})$ is the probability of winning and $P(\\\\mathrm{lose})$ is the probability of losing.\\nGame, Mechanism, and Auction The Bayesian game provides a good theoretical ground for auctions. A Bayesian game is defined by the setting and the mechanism. The setting is the stage and different mechanisms lead to different equilibria and properties.\\n   Bayesian Game Setting A Bayesian game setting is defined by $(N, O, \\\\Theta, p, u)$, where1\\n $N$ is a finite set of $n$ agents or players, e.g., bidders $\\\\{\\\\mathscr B_i\\\\}$, $O$ is a set of outcomes, $\\\\Theta$ is a set of possibe types for each agent, e.g., a bidder can be type one who would squeeze in to get the deal, or type two who would avoid competitions, $p$ is some prior probability (distribution) on types $\\\\{\\\\theta_i\\\\}$, i.e., $p(\\\\Theta)$, that is shared by all agents, $u$ is a set of utility functions for all agents.

With the mechanism defined, we will be able to design, implement, and measure the game.\\n  Y. Shoham and K. Leyton-Brown, “Multiagent systems: Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, and logical foundations,” Multiagent Syst. Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, Log. Found., vol. 9780521899, pp. 1–483, 2008. \\u0026#x21a9;\\u0026#xfe0e;\\n       The fact that auction is an allocation mechanism indicates that the outcome will be two parts, the allocation of the object $X$ and the payment $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ in a $n$ bidder auction. Comparing to the Bayesian game, we have the stage\\n $n$ bidders $\\\\{\\\\mathscr B_i\\\\}$ as the agents, the allocation $X$ together with the payment $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ are the outcomes, the valuation strutures are the types, the probability distribution of the valuation structures is the common prior, utility functions of the bidders as the utility function.  We also have the mechamism\\n bidding at different time and prices as actions, allocation rule (or choice rule) and payment rule maps the actions to the allocation results $X$ and payment results $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$.     Mechanism The way we split the mechamism map $M$ into $X$ and $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ makes it a quasilinear mechamism, which is defined by a triple $(A_i, \\\\chi, \\\\wp)$, where1\\n $A$ a set of actions available to bidders $\\\\{B_i\\\\}$, $\\\\xi$ is the choice rule that maps actions to distribution of allocations, $\\\\wp$ is the payment rule that maps actions to the payments.

Base on the allocation rules and payment rules, we may have first-price auction (FPA), second-price auction (SPA), English ascending-bid auction, Dutch descending-bid auction, etc3. Shoham and Leyton-Brown show a list of canonical auctions in their book4.\\nFirst-price Auction There are three key relations:\\n map from valuation $v_i$ to bid $b_i$, aka bidding function, map from bidding $b_i$ to probability of winning $P(\\\\mathrm{win})$.  Given the probability of winning, valuation, and bid, one could usually calculate the expected utility $\\\\bar U_i$.\\nReferences   F.

Many have played or have been playing their own parts in this great tradition and road transportation is one of the most important modes.\\n  source: undraw.co\\n  Road transportation can either be moving passengers or goods. The latter is also called road freight. In this part, we will focus on road freight.\\nRoad freight is a rather complex system. It depends on multiple fields of research.\\nDefinition of the Problem    What is Road Freight The core activity of road freight is to move materials of some properties (weight $W$, volume $V$, and special requirements), $\\\\mathscr L(W,V,\\\\cdots)$, through route $\\\\mathscr R$ in the road network that connects a set of locations $\\\\{P_1, P_2, \\\\cdots, P_m, D_1, D_2, \\\\cdots, D_n\\\\}$, under some certain policies $\\\\mathscr P$ (order of locations, speed limits, height limit, travel restrictions, etc), using predefined vehicles $\\\\mathscr V$.     In the problem, four key factors are involved:\\n Loads: $\\\\mathscr L$; Routes: $\\\\mathscr R$; Policies: $\\\\mathscr P$; Vehicles/Capacities: $\\\\mathscr V$  Loads are loaded on to the vehicles at the pickup location and unloaded at the dropoff location. Different loads requires different facilities and equipment at pickup and dropoff, as well as different vehicles, routes, and drivers during transportation. Efficient routing also involves information on transportation time requirements, road and traffic status, and weather forecast. Different policies may be enforced by the government and shippers. The vehicles or capacities to be used is a result of the loads and policies.\\nIn many cases, the four factors are interconnect which renders a global optimization problem. Though trivial, it is important to point out that a bunch of other parties, such as infrastructure-related parties, policy makers, security staff, routing services, may also participate in this trip.\\nShipper and Carriers There are two core parties in road freight: the shipper and the carrier. The shipper is the party who provides the load and sets the expectations. The carrier is the party who transports the load.\\nA simple case is shown in the following Gantt chart.\\ngantt title A Workflow dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD section Shipper Coordinate Pickup :2020-01-01, 1d Coordinate Dropoff :2020-01-05, 1d Receive Proof of Delivery to Shipper :2020-01-06,1d Pay the Carrier :2020-01-07, 1d section Carrier Carrier Get Loads :2020-01-01, 1d Fetch Loads at Pickup Location :2020-01-02, 1d Transport to Dropoff Location :2020-01-03, 2d Dropoff :2020-01-05, 1d Provide Proof of Delivery to Shipper :2020-01-06,1d Receive the Payment :2020-01-07, 1d   Forwarders and Marketplaces In reality, connecting the shipper and carrier is no easy task. Apart from the two core parties, a third trustworthy party is usually involved. This can be either a forwarder or a marketplace. A forwarder takes in shipments from the shipper and finds a carrier for the shipment. A marketplace connects the shippers and carriers directly.\\nNetwork and Terminals The shipment may not go directly from the pickup location to the dropoff location. Networks and terminals may be use to aggregate shipments or change of transportation mode to maximize efficiency.\\n  Network and Terminals   How is Road Freight Doing  In physics, the work is measured by force multiplied by displacement. The work done per unit time is the power. There are analogies of work and power in road freight.\\n To measure the \\u0026ldquo;work\\u0026rdquo; done by road freight, a convenient measure is the weight multiplied by the distance of the trip. As an example, the unit of this \\u0026ldquo;work\\u0026rdquo; may be million tonne-kilometer.\\nIn Europe, many countries rely on road freight for transportation. To get a grasp of this idea, we measure the share of road freight of inland transportation using the percentage of tonne-kilometer transported by road freight. Most EU countries has more than half of the freight transported by road freight. In some countries, such as Malta, road freight is the single most important mode of freight transportation.\\n  Road Freight Share in EUUsing data from eurostats\\n  For the top road freight countries, the \\u0026ldquo;work\\u0026rdquo; done by road freight has been growing in the world in recent years. China and India even had one order of magnitude growth in 20 years.\\n  Road Freight Power by YearUsing data from OECD (2020), Freight transport (indicator). This figure excludes rail freight.\\n  Meanwhile, the investment on road infrastructure each year has always been huge in many countries.\\n  Road Freight Investment by YearUsing data from ITF (2020), Transport infrastructure investment and maintenance, ITF Transport Statistics (database)\\n  References  ITF Transport Outlook Project  Modal split of freight transpor (% in total inland freight tonne-km) by Eurostats OECD (2020), Freight transport (indicator). doi: 10.1787/708eda32-en (Accessed on 17 May 2020) ITF (2020), \\u0026ldquo;Transport infrastructure investment and maintenance\\u0026rdquo;, ITF Transport Statistics (database), https://doi.org/10.1787/g2g55573-en (accessed on 17 May 2020).  \"","section":"Basics","summary":"Movements of people, goods and information have always been fundamental components of human societies.\n\u0026ndash; J.
