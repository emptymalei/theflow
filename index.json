If we were to define the objectives of road freight, one of them would be moving materials of some properties (weight, volume, and special requirements) and go through a squence of locations $(P_1, P_2, \\\\cdots, P_m, D_1, D_2, \\\\cdots, D_n)$, under some certain policies (speed limits, height limit, travel restrictions, etc).\\nSeveral Parties Involved There are two core parties in road freight: the shipper and the carrier. The shipper is the party who provides the load and sets the expectations. The carrier is the party who transports the load.\\nA simple case is shown in the following Gantt chart.\\ngantt title A Workflow dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD section Shipper Coordinate Pickup :2020-01-01, 1d Coordinate Dropoff :2020-01-05, 1d Receive Proof of Delivery to Shipper :2020-01-06,1d Pay the Carrier :2020-01-07, 1d section Carrier Carrier Get Loads :2020-01-01, 1d Fetch Loads at Pickup Location :2020-01-02, 1d Transport to Dropoff Location :2020-01-03, 2d Dropoff :2020-01-05, 1d Provide Proof of Delivery to Shipper :2020-01-06,1d Receive the Payment :2020-01-07, 1d   In reality, connecting the shipper and carrier is no easy task. Apart from the two core parties, a third trustworth party is usually invovled. This is the forwarder. The forwarder takes in shipments from the shipper and finds a carrier for the shipment.\\nThough trivial, it is important to point out that a bunch of other parties, such as infrastructure related parties, policy makers, security staff, routing services, may also participate in this trip.\\nHow is Road Freight Doing  In physics, the work is measured by force multiplied by displacement.\\n To measure the \\u0026ldquo;work\\u0026rdquo; done by road freight, a convinient measure is weight multiplied by the distance of the trip. As an example, the unit of this \\u0026ldquo;work\\u0026rdquo; may be million tonne-kilometer.\\nThroughout the years, the \\u0026ldquo;work\\u0026rdquo; done by road freight has been growing.\\n  Road Freight Power by YearOECD (2020), Freight transport (indicator).

I am trained as a theoretical physicist. In essence, theoretical physicist develops compressing algorithms to describe the complicated physical world. What are the good representations of logistics? Are there compressing algorithms to summarize these representations using simple principles? How do we understand them and create better logistics systems? I am sure there are already answers to these questions. I will dig them up.\\nTo make sure that I do not rush into the wrong way, I need your expertise.
