Notations Naively, an auction is observed to have several factors. To save keystrokes, we use a set of symbols to denote the variables:
the seller $\mathscr S$, the bidders $\{\mathscr B_i\}$, the object $\mathscr O$ to bid on, the bidding prices $\{b_i\}$. In an auction, each bidder $\mathscr B_i$ decides on a valuation $v_i$ of the object $\mathscr O$ and bid with a bidding price $b_i$ based on the valuation.</description></item><item><title>Supply and Demand</title><link>/economics/microeconomics/supply-demand/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/economics/microeconomics/supply-demand/</guid><description>In this section, we will discuss supply and demand.
Notations We will be discussing the two aspects of both supply and demand, the values and the functions.
Price: $P$ Demand function: $D$ Quantity of demand, i.e., the value of the demand function for a certain set of variables: $Q_d$ Supply function: $S$ Quantity of supply: $Q_s$ Quantity of demand or supply: $Q$ Some auxiliary variables:</description></item><item><title>The Origin-Destination Matrix</title><link>/road-freight/basics/origin-destination-matrix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/road-freight/basics/origin-destination-matrix/</guid><description>In this section, we will be looking into the so-called origin-destination matrix, or the OD matrix. The OD matrix tells us the trip distribution between a pair of locations $(p, q)$. There are many representations of the OD matrix. It can be represented using a matrix, a network, or the generating process behind it.
Notations In this page, we will use the following notations.
$P$: a set of origins; $p$: an element of $P$, i.</description></item></channel></rss>
