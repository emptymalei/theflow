Road freight is easily spotted in our daily life. As discussed in [What is Road Freight]({{< ref "/road-freight/basics/what-is-road-freight.md" >}}), road freight can make up a dominating fraction of freight transportation in some countries such as Malta. However, other modes of transportation are also key to the material flow.

## Characteristics of the Transportation Modes

|  | Road Freight | Rail Freight | Water Ways | Ocean Freight | Air Freight |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Speed |  Fast  |  Fast  |  Slow  |  Slow  |  Fast |
| Capacity | Small | Large | Large | Large | Small |
| Price | Low | Low | Low | Low | High |
| Environmental Impact | High | Low | Low | Low | High |
| Coverage | High | Low | Low | Low | Low |

Each mode has its own use cases. In the real world, the modes are competing with each other in many situations.
