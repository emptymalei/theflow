Road freight is easily spotted in our daily life. As discussed in [What is Road Freight]({{< ref "/road-freight/basics/what-is-road-freight.md" >}}), road freight can make up a dominating fraction of freight transportation in some countries such as Malta. However, other modes of transportation are also key to the material flow.

## Characteristics of the Transportation Modes

|  | Road Freight | Rail Freight | Water Ways | Ocean Freight | Air Freight |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Speed |  Fast  |  Fast  |  Slow  |  Slow  |  Fast |
| Capacity | Small | Large | Large | Large | Small |
| Price | Low | Low | Low | Low | High |
| Environmental Impact | High | Low | Low | Low | High |
| Coverage | High | Low | Low | Low | Low |

Each mode has its own use cases. In the real world, the modes are competing with each other in many situations.

### Speed

Different countries has different speed limits for freight vehicles. In Europe, the general speed limit is around 80km/h on expressways.[^EUSpeedLimit] [^EUSpeedLimitCalculator] For completeness, we also visualized the [data table on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limits_by_country) in [topics: speed limits]({{< ref "/road-freight/topics/road-speed-limits.md" >}}).

The rail freight speed is comparable to road freight speeds (around 80km/h).[^EUFreightISI] However, European court of auditors found that the speed of freight trains are actually quite slow on some international routes (18 km/h) as well as some countries (20-30 km/h).[^RailFreightinEU] Ocean container ships cruise at the speed of 30â€“46 km/h.[^ContainerShipWikipedia] Cargo aircrafts cruise at the speed of 500-900 km/h. [^CargoAircraftWikipedia]

However, the speed of the vehicles doesn't necessarily determine the time for the cargo from door to door. Rail freight, ocean freight and air freight relies on the locations of ports and thus are mostly not door to door services. Additional transitions are requires for the cargo to reach from pickup locations to drop off locations.

### Coverage


In principle, freight trucks can go whereever the road is covered if we ignore the regulations. Ocean freight only connects ports. In 2019, 2397 ports in EU reported nonzero cargo volumes.[^VolumebyPortEU] Air freight connects airports. In Q4 of 2019, there are 272 airports reported nonzero freight and mail volumes in all the 28 countries of EU.[^FMinEU2019Q4]
