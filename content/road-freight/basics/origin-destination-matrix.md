In this section, we will be looking into the so-called origin-destination matrix, or the OD matrix. The OD matrix tells us the trip distribution between a pair of locations $(p, q)$. There are many representations of the OD matrix. It can be represented using a matrix, a network, or the generating process behind it.

{{< info title="Notations">}}
In this page, we will use the following notations.

1. $P$: a set of origins;
2. $p$: an element of $P$, i.e., an origin;
3. $Q$: a set of destinations;
4. $q$: an element of $Q$, i.e., a destination;
5. $o_p$: total flow out of the origin $p$;
6. $d_q$: total flow into destination $q$;
7. $g_{pq}$: flow between origin $p$ and destination $q$.
8. $\\{g_{pq}\\}$: the travel demand.
