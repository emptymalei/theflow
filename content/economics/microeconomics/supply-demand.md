In this section, we will discuss supply and demand.


{{< info title="Notations">}}
We will be discussing the two aspects of both supply and demand, the values and the functions.

- Price: $P$
- Demand function: $D$
- Quantity of demand, i.e., the value of the demand function for a certain set of variables: $Q_d$
- Supply function: $S$
- Quantity of supply: $Q_s$
- Quantity of demand or supply: $Q$

Some auxiliary variables:

- Income of the community: $I_c$

The supply function and demand function are functions of many variables. The most discussed variables are prices $P$.

## Demand

{{< figure src="../assets/demand_function.png" caption="A very simple demand function">}}

The demand function specifies the relation between price $P$ and the quantity of demand $Q_d$. Though the relation is between the two values, the relation itself is determined by many different factors such as the average income of the community $I_c$. Thus changes in these factors, such as increase in the income, will change the relation between the prices and quantity of demand.

The demand function as a function of many variables is properly defined by a function of these variables. In the above example, the demand function is a function of price $P$ and the income of the community $I_c$.

For simplicity, we only discuss the relation between price $P$ and the quantity of demand $Q_d$. All the changes in the relations due to other variables will be obscured.

## Supply

Similar to demand, the supply function is also represented by the relation between the price $P$ and the quantity of supply $Q_s$. The dependencies on other variables will be viewed as shifts in the relation between $P$ and $Q_s$.

## Supply and Demand Analysis

The supply and demand analysis is a useful tool to think about the price changes.
