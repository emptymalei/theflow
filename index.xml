&amp;ndash; J. P. Rodrigue, C. Comtois, and B. Slack, The geography of transport systems. 2006.
A large part of human civilization is to move materials around. Many have played or have been playing their own parts in this great tradition and road transportation is one of the most important modes.

As discussed in What is Road Freight, road freight can make up a dominating fraction of freight transportation in some countries such as Malta. However, other modes of transportation are also key to the material flow.

The OD matrix tells us the trip distribution between a pair of locations $(p, q)$. There are many representations of the OD matrix. It can be represented using a matrix, a network, or the generating process behind it.
Notations
In this page, we will use the following notations.
$P$: a set of origins; $p$: an element of $P$, i.</description></item><item><title>Describe a Location</title><link>https://flow.leima.is/road-freight/basics/describe-geolocations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flow.leima.is/road-freight/basics/describe-geolocations/</guid><description>We can use three types of properties to describe a location1:
Site details (is there a ramp? is it on the wrong side of the road?); Accessibility; Socioeconomic environment. The three types of properties of a location.
The site details and the socioeconomic environment is understood by the name. Here we will discuss the accessibility of a location.
