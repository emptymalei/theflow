The OD matrix tells us the trip distribution between a pair of locations $(p, q)$. There are many representations of the OD matrix. It can be represented using a matrix, a network, or the generating process behind it.
Notations
In this page, we will use the following notations.
$P$: a set of origins; $p$: an element of $P$, i.</description></item><item><title>Describe a Location</title><link>https://flow.leima.is/road-freight/basics/describe-geolocations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flow.leima.is/road-freight/basics/describe-geolocations/</guid><description>We can use three types of properties to describe a location1:
