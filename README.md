# The FLow

I am a data scientist in logistics with limited knowledge of logistics. In my work, I learned all kinds of terms and pieces of domain knowledge. However, I am not connecting the dots.

Why am I writing this? As a data scientist, I am not well educated in logistics. However, I work in the field of logistics and I find it intriguing.

I need a big picture.

To build this big picture, I need to learn from others and build my own view of logistics.

Besides this utilitarian point of view, I am also curious about the hidden principles of logistics. I am trained as a theoretical physicist. Theoretical physics is a field that develops compressing algorithms to describe our complicated physical world. What are the good representation of logistics? Is there a compressing algorithm that summarizes these representations to simple principles? How do we really understand them and make logistics sever us better?
