# The FLow

I am a data scientist in logistics with limited knowledge of logistics. In my work, I learned all kinds of terms and pieces of domain knowledge. However, I am not connecting the dots.

I am trained as a theoretical physicist. Theoretical physics is a field that develops compressing algorithms to describe our complicated physical world.
